# Hierarchy and topology of CYFS protocol

Let's look at the [readme in official repository](https://github.com/buckyos/CYFS/blob/main/README.md) first.

![Hierarchy and topology of CYFS protocol](https://github.com/buckyos/CYFS/blob/main/doc/zh-CN/image/CYFS%20Architecture.png)

The above is the overall architecture diagram of CYFS, which can help to establish a macro understanding of the design of CYFS. The core design of CYFS can be decomposed into the following parts

-   Design of NamedObject and double-section construction of cyfs://o/$ownerid/$objid (Object Link).
-   The BDT protocol improves TCP/IP: the network protocol evolves from address-oriented to trusted identity-oriented.
-   MetaChain upgrades DNS, realizes decentralized addressing, and realizes Data is Account.
-   The Owner deploys its own server OOD (Owner Online Device) on the network, which supports the decentralized accessibility of cyfs://
-   Design proofs of storage and proofs of service based on the game-based consensus theory of dispute before going on the chain, and realize the decentralized high reliability and high availability of cyfs://
-   The off-chain delivery of computing resources is separated from on-chain matching, and an evolvable economic model is used to build decentralized shared cloud computing
-   Data property rights analysis based on the input and results of trusted computing, to realize the evolution from on-chain smart contracts to off-chain Data Exchage Contract (DEC).
-   The Service of Web3 DEC App is installed on everyone's OOD, realizing the decentralization of application services

There are also two auxiliary connectivity devices that are not mentioned:

-   SN: `Super Node`.It's service that assists devices deployed in NAT to communicate with each other. In CYFS, anyone can deploy a SN server, and anyone can freely choose the appropriate SN server.Both parties complete the transaction through SN service contract and service certificate.

-   PN: `Proxy Node`. They are used as proxies to transfer data when both communication devices cannot complete a direct connection. As the SN service, anyone can deploy a PN server, and anyone can freely choose the appropriate PN server.Both parties complete the transaction through PN service contract and service certificate.

Explain some new words:

-   Zone: The devices owned by the same owner. It can be represented by its owner. Unowned devices are allowed, it will form a zone that include it only. All devices can connect each other directly.

-   OOD: `Owner Online Device`, The central device of a zone, it builds a star network with other devices, it assists other devices in the same zone to communicate with the other zones. And it is the centralized storage of data in the zone, running as a service(gateway) in http. It's the most important device for a zone in `CYFS`, it's the `personal server` for the user.

-   MetaChain: It is a blockchain system that maintains the consensus of each node in the CYFS network.Its implementation is not yet complete, just a conceptual version?
