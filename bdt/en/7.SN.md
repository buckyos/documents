# Super Node
SN(Super Node), is used to discover the NAT-mapped address of device, query device information, and assist hole-punching; SN node should be deployed on a static public ip addressed, udp-friendly device.

## ping to SN node
+ Device sends SNPing packet to SN node's udp address;
```rust
pub struct SnPing {
    pub seq: TempSeq,                         
    pub sn_peer_id: DeviceId,                 
    pub from_peer_id: Option<DeviceId>,     
    pub peer_info: Option<Device>,             
    pub send_time: Timestamp,                 
    pub contract_id: Option<ObjectId>,       
    pub receipt: Option<ReceiptWithSignature>, 
}
```
+ SN node receives SNPing Packet from device, records device's local and public addresses, replies device's public address with a SNPingResp packet; 
```rust
pub struct SnPingResp {
    pub seq: TempSeq,                     
    pub sn_peer_id: DeviceId,             
    pub result: u8,                        
    pub peer_info: Option<Device>,        
    pub end_point_array: Vec<Endpoint>,    
    pub receipt: Option<SnServiceReceipt>, 
}
```

## forward connection request
+ To connect a remote device, send SNCall packet to SN node on which remote device has pinged to.
+ When SN node receives a SNCall packet, if SN node has target device's record, forward SNCall packet with a SnCalled packet to target;
