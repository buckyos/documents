# Chunk Concept
Chunk is the smallest storage unit;
Contains Chunk Storage, Upload, Download, Manager, Chunk-list and Encode modules;

## Chunk ID
The unique identifier of each chunk, the feature value obtained by completing the hash calculation through the content of the chunk, is used to identify the chunk and verify the content of the chunk;

## Chunk Storage
Chunk writes the interface;
```rust
pub trait ChunkWriter: 'static + std::fmt::Display + Send + Sync {
    // write a set of chunks to the file
    async fn write(&self, chunk: &ChunkId, content: Arc<Vec<u8>>) -> BuckyResult<()>;
    async fn finish(&self) -> BuckyResult<()>;
}

pub trait ChunkWriterExt: 'static + std::fmt::Display + Send + Sync {
    // write a set of chunks to the file
    async fn write(&self, chunk: &ChunkId, content: Arc<Vec<u8>>, range: Option<Range<u64>>) -> BuckyResult<()>;
    async fn finish(&self) -> BuckyResult<()>;
}
```
ChunkWrite and ChunkWriteExt provide Chunk write interface for the application layer, which is called by bdt;

After receiving a complete chunk of data, bdt requests the write interface to the upper layer;

After receiving all Chunk data, request the finish interface to the upper layer;

Chunk read interface
```rust
pub trait ChunkReader: 'static + Send + Sync {
    async fn exists(&self, chunk: &ChunkId) -> bool;
    async fn get(&self, chunk: &ChunkId) -> BuckyResult<Arc<Vec<u8>>>;
}
```
During the NDN handshake, bdt queries the integrity of Chunk data through the exists method. If it is missing or forwarded, it will be fed back to the requester by bdt through a different ErrorCode;

After completing the NDN handshake, the upload driver calls get to the upper layer to request the Chunk data content;


## Chunk Manager
```rust
pub struct ChunkManager {
    stack: WeakStack, 
    ndc: Box<dyn NamedDataCache>, 
    tracker: Box<dyn TrackerCache>, 
    store: Box<dyn ChunkReader>, 
    gen_session_id: TempSeqGenerator, 
    views: RwLock<BTreeMap<ChunkId, ChunkView>>, 
}
```
* ndc：NamedDataCache，Data cache method interface;
* tracker：（omitted）
* store：（omitted）
* gen_session_id：Global sequence auto-increment id;
* views：ChunkView's map table;


## Chunk Task
Chunk task includes download tasks, download scheduling, etc.;
```rust
fn start(&self) -> TaskState;
```
Start a Chunk download process, which creates the ChunkView view and downloads it to the end;


## Chunk View
Chunk view, including chunk pull, upload/download session start, resource scheduling, etc.;

```rust
async fn create_view(&self, chunk: ChunkId, init_state: ChunkState) -> BuckyResult<ChunkView>;
```
Create/get ChunkView by the ChunkManager according to ChunkId;
A ChunkView can work in both directions or with multiple sources;


### ChunkView::load
```rust
    pub async fn load(&self) -> BuckyResult<()>;
```
After a ChunkView is created, it enters the load stage. 
At this time, it will judge whether the chunk exists, whether it is backed up at the remote end and other resource information, and mark the status of the chunk;


### ChunkView::start_upload And ChunkView::start_download
```rust
pub fn start_upload(
    &self, 
    session_id: TempSeq, 
    piece_type: PieceSessionType, 
    to: Channel, 
    owner: ResourceManager) -> BuckyResult<UploadSession>;
```
```rust
pub fn start_download(
    &self, 
    config: Arc<ChunkDownloadConfig>, 
    owner: ResourceManager
) -> BuckyResult<ChunkDownloader>;
```
Along with the creation and loading of ChunkView, the start_download/start_upload process is triggered by the ChunkManager;

The downloader attempts to send an [interest](#interest) request;

After the uploader receives the Interest request, it starts the upload session;

After the downloader receives the successful response from RespInterest, it starts processing [PieceData data](#piecedata-sending-and-receiving-process)


## Interest/PieceData/PieceControl Packet
Introduce the NDN handshake protocol and Chunk transport protocol;


### Interest
Used to negotiate Chunk transmission between end users;
```rust
pub struct Interest {
    pub session_id: TempSeq, 
    pub chunk: ChunkId,
    pub prefer_type: PieceSessionType, 
    pub referer: Option<String>,
}
```
* session_id The session id that started the NDN transfer;
* chunk：The Chunk ID that needs to be downloaded;
* refer_type：Encoding：[Stream](#stream编码)，[Raptor](#raptor编码);
* referer：omitted

Handling the Interest protocol:
 * Chunk download;
 * Re-request Chunk download;
Respond to the RespInterest protocol to the requester:
```rust
pub struct RespInterest {
    pub session_id: TempSeq, 
    pub chunk: ChunkId,  
    pub err: BuckyErrorCode,
    pub cache_node: Option<DeviceId>,
}
```
* session_id、chunk: consistent with the Interest protocol;
* err：Error code；
  - If successful, return BuckyErrorCode::Ok;
  - If there is no target Chunk information, return BuckyErrorCode::NotFound;
  - If you need to redirect, return BuckyErrorCode::SessionRedirect;
* cache_node：When the value of err is equal to BuckyErrorCode::SessionRedirect, the available jump DeviceId will be returned here; otherwise, it is None;


## Channel
When performing NDN transmission at the remote end, Channel provides services for upload/download sessions, and handles [PieceData sending and receiving process](#piecedata-sending-and-receiving-process);


## PieceData Sending And Receiving Process
After receiving the PieceData protocol data from the network interface, it is processed by the Channel bound to the remote DeviceId;


### PieceData
We set the maximum transmission of a Data to be 1472 bytes;
A Chunk will be divided into one or more PieceData transmission units, which have been completed during the NDN handshake;
```rust
pub struct PieceData {
    pub est_seq: Option<TempSeq>,
    pub session_id: TempSeq, 
    pub chunk: ChunkId, 
    pub desc: PieceDesc, 
    pub data: Vec<u8>,
}
```
* est_seq：Self-incrementing sequence number, only used in udp protocol transmission;
* session_id，chunk：consistent with the Interest protocol;
* desc：Corresponds to PieceSessionType in the Interest request;
* data：Chunk content;

The packet length of a PieceData = 1472 - the header part of the PieceData;
Whether it is tcp/udp, after receiving a PieceData, it needs to return a PieceControl packet, and the source end will only send the next PieceData after receiving the PieceControl packet;


### PieceControl
```rust
pub struct PieceControl {
    pub sequence: TempSeq, 
    pub session_id: TempSeq, 
    pub chunk: ChunkId, 
    pub command: PieceControlCommand, 
    pub max_index: Option<u32>, 
    pub lost_index: Option<Vec<Range<u32>>>
}
```
* sequence，session_id，chunk：consistent with the PieceData protocol;
* PieceControlCommand：Contains four actions to identify the next step of the requester, namely (Continue, Finish, Pause, Cancel);
* max_index，lost_index：The Data index that needs to be retransmitted is missing; if the source receives the lost_index value, it will re-plan the transmission index and retransmit the lost PieceData;


### Handling PieceData
```rust
    fn on_piece_data(&self, piece: PieceData) -> BuckyResult<()>;
```
After the Channel decodes a complete Chunk data, it notifies the ChunkWriter to complete the writing;


### Handling PieceControl
```rust
    fn on_piece_control(&self, ctrl: &PieceControl) -> BuckyResult<()>;
```
Process the sending and receiving process of PieceData according to PieceControlCommand;


## Stream Encoding
This is a content stream that blocks Chunk content according to the size of each PieceData;
Subsequent PieceData processing is also sent in sequence according to the range_index of each data;


## Raptor Encoding
Fountain code, introduced into NDN project by open source;
More encoding forms can also be introduced in PieceData;


## Dual Source
The introduction of dual sources, on the one hand, can help reduce the pressure of data transmission at the source end, and on the other hand, it can improve the faster reception of local data and help improve the transmission rate;
