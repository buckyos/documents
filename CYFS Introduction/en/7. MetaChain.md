# MetaChain

This is the main chain of `CYFS`, and the final goal is to become an open public chain, but it is still a concept version. It currently does not support contract development. If you need to do related extensions, you need to hard-code the new `Tx` type in the `meta` module.

Because this is a temporary implementation version, I won't introduce too much.

If you have relevant suggestions or comments, welcome to discuss.
