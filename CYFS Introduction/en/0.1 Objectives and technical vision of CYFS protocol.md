# Objectives and technical vision of CYFS protocol

Our goal is to become http 3.0 (to be discussed).

-   It's a basic upgrade to the http protocol, like this:

```
http://192.168.100.188/path => cyfs://$wallet_addr/path
```

-   It will reduce the cost of building trusted URLs and realize a decentralized trusted infrastructure:

1. Solve 404 issues. You can save your data in `CYFS` anytime if you want.
   It's not mean that you can open the data anytime even the data is removed.
   It's meaning that, If you want, you can easily choose to save the data permanently, such as storing it in the blockchain or saving it off-site in the backup system.
2. Build immutable URLs. You can refer to any URL without worrying about it being tampered with by the source website.
