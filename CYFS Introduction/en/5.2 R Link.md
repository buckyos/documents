# `R` Link

It's like below:

```
cyfs://$target_zone.r/$dec_id/$inner_path[?mode=json&mime=txt]
```

-   $target_zone: As the domain for http, It represents the zone who will receive and responce the request.
-   $dec_id: The DecApp(like service of http) which will maintain the state, and responce the request.
-   $inner_path: The path of the `Object` saved on [RootState](https://github.com/buckyos/CYFS/issues/132#issuecomment-1476048950).

Different from `O` link, the content specified by `R` link can be modified by the owner, It behaves much like http, and we can use it instead of http.

## Domain for `R` Link

Different from `O` link, the domain of `R` link is depend on the `DecApp`. So, there are cross domain issues and defense. We must open the permissions to the target `DecApp` to allow it's access.
