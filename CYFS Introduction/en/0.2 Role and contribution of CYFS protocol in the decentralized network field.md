# Role and Contribution of CYFS Protocol in Decentralized Network Field

1. By upgrading the http:// protocol, traditional web application developers can develop decentralized applications in a familiar way. This significantly lowers the entry barrier for Web3 developers, allowing more developers to enter the Web3 field and providing a solid foundation for the emergence of large-scale killer Web3 applications.
2. The distributed network architecture enables developers to not worry about large-scale concurrency issues in most situations.
3. Large-scale off-chain data exchange greatly reduces the number of on-chain transactions, effectively reducing the usage cost of Web3 applications.
