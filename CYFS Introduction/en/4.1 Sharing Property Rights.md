# Sharing Property Rights

There are many entities in the world other than people,family,club,company,country,etc.They are organizations made up of many people,the people are related, or they have the same purpose or hobby.They have common assets and often have to make resolutions on matters.They also have personal positions and interests.

There are many solutions for web2:

-   Information system for enterprise
-   Community in `Github`
-   Server in `Discord`
-   etc.

The data stored in the `IT` system by these organizations should be owned by themself. Members of these organizations share the property rights of these data, and they jointly manage the data status (addition, update, deletion and query).

In the web3 era, we need a decentralized solution to make sure the users to obtain more autonomy and more certain rights and interests. Blockchain provides us with a good idea.We can make these applications run on a `Consortium Blockchain`.
