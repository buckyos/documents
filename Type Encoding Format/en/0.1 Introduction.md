# Introduction

I want to collect and organize various information encoding formats in the `CYFS` protocol in this document. By reading this article, you can gain the ability to:

1. Correctly encode various information to store or exchange with other peers.
2. Correctly restore the encoded information obtained from the storage system or other peers.
3. When designing a new composite type, understand the data encoding specification, and be able to correctly select the appropriate basic type for encoding and decoding.
