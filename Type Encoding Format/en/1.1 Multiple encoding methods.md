# Multiple encoding methods

All information based on `CYFS` can choose one of the following three encoding methods. Both `Protobuf` and `JSON` have their standard encoding specifications. I wonâ€™t go into details here. We only introduce the binary encoding format.

1. Binary

    Binary format encoding, usually used for standardized fixed encoding, the most space-saving, but not easy to expand.

    When binary encoding is selected, the type designer needs to fill all fields into a `Buffer` one by one in a certain order.

2. Protobuf

    Using `Protobuf` encoding, while taking into account certain space efficiency and scalability, this is the encoding method selected by most complex types.

    When using `Protobuf` encoding, the type designer only needs to assign each field of the object to the corresponding `Protobuf` type, and then use the `Protobuf` method to encode and decode. Compatibility processing needs to refer to the `Protobuf` specification.

    ** Note: The `Protobuf` specification we chose is `Proto3`, considering backward compatibility, the `Protobuf` version is unlikely to be upgraded. Of course, other versions can be selected for the type of new design, but different versions need to be carefully introduced. **

3. JSON

    Encoded in `JSON`, which is less space efficient but more readable.

    Because of its low space efficiency, the `JSON` method is usually not selected to encode and decode information. `JSON` encoding usually appears in the scene of human-computer interaction.

** No matter which encoding method you choose, you must pay attention to the stability of the encoding when you use it for object encoding (for example: `Set` and `Map` should pay attention to the order of each element), otherwise the `ObjectId` obtained by calculating the same content multiple times may be different. **
